Workflow:
Noise Reduction (DeNoise.m):
Create a folder named 'labeledImage'.
Run DeNoise.m to apply noise reduction techniques to the images.
Image Splitting (Split.m):
Create a folder named 'SplitLabeledImage' with three sub-folders: '0', '1', and '2'.
Run Split.m to split the denoised images into three parts, each containing a single digit.
Network Training (trainer.m):
Run trainer.m to train a CNN using the split images.
The trained network is saved as 'net.mat'.
Classifier Evaluation (evaluate_classifier.m):
Run evaluate_classifier.m to evaluate the performance of the trained classifier.

Processes:
Image Preprocessing:
Convert the original image I to a binary image Ibinary using thresholding.
Use imclose to remove noise from the binary image, resulting in IbinaryAfterClosing.
Image Splitting:
Split the denoised image into three parts, each containing a single digit.
Save the split images into the respective sub-folders '0', '1', and '2'.
CNN Design:
The CNN architecture is designed with the following layers:
imageInputLayer: Input layer with dimensions [50 35 1] to accommodate the image size.
convolution2dLayer: Three convolutional layers with different filter sizes and numbers of filters, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
maxPooling2dLayer: Two max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
fullyConnectedLayer: Fully connected layer with 3 outputs.
softmaxLayer: Softmax layer for classification.
classificationLayer: Classification output layer.
Classifier Testing (myclassifier.m):
myclassifier.m is a script to prepare test images and classify them using the trained CNN.

Codes:
DeNoise.m: Implements noise reduction techniques on the images.
Split.m: Splits denoised images into three parts and saves them in '0', '1', or '2' folders based on the digit they contain.
trainer.m: Trains the CNN using split images and saves the trained network as 'net.mat'.
evaluate_classifier.m: Evaluates the classifier's performance using the test data and the trained network.
myclassifier.m: Prepares test images and classifies them using the trained CNN.
